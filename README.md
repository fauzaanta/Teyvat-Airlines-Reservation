# Teyvat-Airlines-Reservation

## Background
The Teyvat Airlines Reservation Program was developed to address the complexity of airline ticket booking, which requires multiple variables and calculations, as well as robust error handling to process inputs accurately. The team aimed to apply their semester-long learning to create a functional program. Additionally, they observed that many existing ticket booking platforms seldom provide information on baggage weight allowances, so this program includes an option for users to check baggage details.

## Objectives
The program is designed to serve as a platform for users to:
1. **Book airline tickets**: Accepting up to five ticket reservations simultaneously with user-defined departure and destination airports.
2. **Process payments**: Offering three payment optionsâ€”cash (onsite), bank transfer, and e-wallet.
3. **Check baggage**: Calculate baggage weights and inform users of any excess baggage fees.
4. **Validation**: Ensure valid travel dates and prevent double seat reservations.
5. **Flexibility**: Allow users to review previously booked tickets, modify reservations, and process refunds for rebooked tickets.

## Limitations
Despite its functionality, the program has several limitations:
1. **Database Integration**: It cannot interact with external files or databases to store user data.
2. **Seat Availability**: It cannot verify seat availability within specific classes.
3. **Simplified Features**: Payment and refund processing are implemented as dummy features without real-world financial integrations.

This program is primarily aimed at buyers looking to reserve airline tickets and provides a foundational approach to ticket booking systems.
